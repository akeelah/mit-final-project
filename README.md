# MIT-Final-Project
This is my project for my masters program in UNILAG. I created a Learning Management System that can be customized by any learning environment: Primary school, Secondary or University. The code is written in PHP and Javascript with MySQL as database.

To install the code first install WAMP server then create a database named "capstone" and import all the tables from the database in the capstone.sql inside the "db" folder. Then copy all the files into the www folder of the WAMP server.

The functions of this system are:

For the admin side of the system
•Add, edit, delete student information
•Add, edit, delete teacher information
•Add entry like subject, class, school calendar
•View log-in trail of every user
•View activity log of every user

To access the admin side of the system just add “/admin” in your url.
